Solar System Project
December 2015
Runs in Visual Studio

Developed a real-time rendering of a solar system
Used Scene-Graphs to calculate the rotation and positions of the planets
Created a bloom effect with image processing to make the sun appear to be glowing
Used shape grammar to procedurally generate asteroids and satellites

So this thing needs a few libraries to run properly.
It uses Glee, freeGlut, GLSL....I think that is it. 

I wrote this readme a while after I demoed it. if you press "q" asteroids will fly across the screen. "r" stops the camera from rotating.
"1" and "2" switch from bloom to no bloom effect on the sun.
